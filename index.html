  <h2>"Golden rain" by Chat GPT</h2>
  <p>
    On a sunny morning, a small village on the outskirts of the Notecka Forest was waking up to life. The residents warmly welcomed the new day, while colorful birds sang in the treetops. In this idyllic scenery, there lived an old druid named Bronisław. He was known for his extraordinary powers that allowed him to communicate with nature.

    That morning, Bronisław felt something unusual in the air. After breakfast, he stepped out of his house wearing his green robe, and headed towards the forest. As he passed through the village, children ran after him, fascinated by stories of his magical powers.

    Deep in the forest, he found a bright clearing where sunlight pierced through the leaves, creating a natural kaleidoscope of colors on the ground. In the center of this luminous circle, there grew an ancient plant he had never seen before. It had green leaves, with delicate golden flowers cascading down like a waterfall.

    Bronisław, enchanted by the beauty of the plant, approached it. As he got closer, the golden flowers began to gently fall to the ground, surrounding him in a golden rain. The druid felt warmth enveloping his body, and his mind filled with images from the past. They were memories of the trees, animals, and the entire forest. At that moment, he understood that the plant was sharing the essence of the forest with him.

    After a few minutes, the golden rain ceased, and Bronisław left the circle of light. He returned to the village, his head full of new stories and wisdom he gained from the forest. The villagers gathered around him, listening with curiosity as he recounted his experiences.

    Days passed, and Bronisław's tales of the golden rain seeped into the hearts of the villagers, teaching them respect and love for nature. The village, which once was indifferent to the beauty of the surrounding forest, now became its guardian.

    Soon, other druids from different parts of the country came to the village to see the magical place the legends talked about. Together with Bronisław, they worked on protecting the forest and its inhabitants, passing on their knowledge to the next generations.

    Over time, the village earned a reputation as a place where people lived in harmony with nature, and the legends of Bronisław's golden rain were passed down from generation to generation. People from all over the world came here to experience the magic that always lingered in the air in this small, yet magical part of the world.

    And Bronisław, although aging, never ceased to share his love for the forest and its mysteries with anyone willing to listen. Every morning, he entered the forest, greeting the new day and giving thanks for all the experiences life had bestowed upon him.
